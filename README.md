# 🛠️ Python Data Toolkit: Modular Analytics Foundations

This repository contains a collection of professional-grade Python modules designed for scalability and reusability. These scripts serve as the technical "foundational blocks" for my work in **Analytics Engineering** and **Data Science**, moving beyond basic scripts into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

### 🎯 Objective
To demonstrate core competency in building modular data tools, implementing mathematical modeling, and performing advanced statistical validation without the use of high-level "black-box" frameworks.

### 📁 What's Inside?

#### 1. Professional Logic Engine (`/01_Basic_Logic`)
- **Financial Growth Analyst:** A Class-based tool that performs compound interest modeling. This module demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, including class initialization, method isolation, and encapsulated mathematical logic.

#### 2. Automated Data Engineering (`/02_Data_Handling`)
- **Automated Preprocessing Pipeline:** A robust data cleaning class that handles missing values dynamically. It uses logic-based imputation (filling numerical data with the **Median** and categorical data with the **Mode**), ensuring datasets are "ML-ready" for large-scale pipelines.

#### 3. Advanced Statistical Visualization (`/03_Visualizations`)
- **Comparative Distribution Analyst:** A tool built with **Seaborn** and **SciPy** that overlays an observed data distribution with a theoretical **Gaussian (Normal) Curve**. This is used to visually validate data "health" and check for skewness before feeding features into a model.

### 🧠 The Engineering Mindset
As an **MS Computer Science student at CSU**, I focus on "Code Reliability." By building these foundational tools as reusable classes, I ensure that my data cleaning and analysis processes are consistent, easy to debug, and production-ready.
