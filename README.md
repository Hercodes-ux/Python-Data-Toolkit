# 🛠️ Python-Data-Toolkit

This repository is a curated collection of my early Python scripts, focusing on mastering **NumPy** and **Pandas** fundamentals. These scripts serve as the technical "stepping stones" I built before moving into complex Machine Learning and Agentic AI workflows.

### 🎯 Objective
To demonstrate core competency in Python logic, data manipulation, and basic visualization without the use of high-level frameworks or AI assistance.

### 📁 What's Inside?

#### 1. Basic Logic (`/01_Basic_Logic`)
- **Simple Calculator:** A script using conditional logic (`if-elif-else`) and functions to perform arithmetic operations. This helped me master Python syntax and error handling (try-except blocks).

#### 2. Data Handling (`/02_Data_Handling`)
- **CSV Stat Reader:** A Pandas-based script that reads a raw dataset, identifies missing values, and calculates basic statistics (Mean, Median, Mode) from scratch.

#### 3. Visualizations (`/03_Visualizations`)
- **Plotting Fundamentals:** Practice scripts using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create histograms and scatter plots, focusing on proper axis labeling and data distribution.

### 🧠 Why this exists
In my journey as an **MS Computer Science student at CSU**, I believe in the "Basics First" philosophy. Understanding how data moves through a simple list or a dictionary is what allows me to debug complex LLM chains today.
